        <p>Welcome to Eduardo Marschall's first webpage</p>
        <p>
            This is a part of The Odin Project. I was tasked with creating
            a website in which I could exercise all the things I have learned 
            so far in regards to HTML. I added two of my favorite recipes here 
            The first one is a recipe that is close to my heart, since my mom 
            used to make waffles all the time for me and my siblings. The way 
            we do it, though, is not as people usually do in the USA. We are not 
            used to have is as a main breakfast component, we usually make a 
            big batch of waffles and have them from time to time for breakfast, 
            afternoon coffee, or even after lunch. We usually freeze a big portion 
            of what we make and defrost it from time to time.

            The second recipe is something that I have always enjoyed doing, 
            I learned how to make caipirinhas while I was dating my first 
            boyfriend. After I got the gist of it, I started to get more 
            adventurous, making caipirinhas with all sorts of fruits, like 
            strawberries, pineapple, cashew, passion fruit and many other 
            combinations. This became "my thing" and I liked being the 
            "barman" of our small parties. I still like making them and I tend 
            to be in charge of doing that in our gatherings, but I don't drink 
            as much anymore.
